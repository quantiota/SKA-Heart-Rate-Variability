# SKA ECG & Heart Rate Variability

**ECG Signal Processing and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis with Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) and Entropy-Based Learning**

This project applies the SKA entropy learning framework to raw ECG signals and heart rate variability (HRV) time series, aiming to discover new informational regimes and subtle physiological patterns not accessible with classical statistics or supervised machine learning.

## Features
- Real-time ECG and HRV analysis using entropy-driven SKA learning
- Extraction of regime transitions and entropy trajectories
- Visualization tools for ECG signals, HRV time series, entropy, and state transitions
- Open-source sample code, datasets, and reproducible figures

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/quantiota/SKA-Heart-Rate-Variability.git`
2. Install requirements  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run analysis notebook or script (see `notebooks/` or `scripts/`)

## Example Figures
> *Add here a key HRV entropy trajectory or regime plot demonstrating unique SKA insights.*

## Why SKA for ECG/HRV?
- **Unsupervised regime change detection** in ECG and HRV
- **Quantifies entropy** even during stable heart rate segments
- **Reveals subtle physiological transitions** invisible to classical ECG and HRV analysis
