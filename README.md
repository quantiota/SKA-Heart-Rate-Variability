# SKA Heart Rate Variability



**Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Exploration with Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) and Entropy-Based Learning**

This project applies the SKA entropy learning framework to heart rate variability (HRV) time series, aiming to discover new informational regimes and subtle physiological patterns not accessible with classical statistics or supervised machine learning.



## Features

- Real-time HRV analysis using entropy-driven SKA learning
- Extraction of regime transitions and entropy trajectories
- Visualization tools for HRV time series, entropy, and state transitions
- Open-source sample code, datasets, and reproducible figures

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/quantiota/SKA-Heart-Rate-Variability.git`
2. Install requirements  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run analysis notebook or script (see `notebooks/` or `scripts/`)

## Why SKA for HRV?

- Detects unsupervised regime changes in HRV
- Quantifies entropy even in periods of stable heart rate
- Reveals subtle physiological transitions that are invisible to conventional HRV analysis


## Citation & Collaboration

If you use or build on this project, please cite the main SKA paper ([arXiv:2503.13942](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13942)) and reach out for collaborative researchâ€”especially if you have medical/clinical HRV datasets!
